## Project 1
This first project is an analysis of the Poisson and Exponential Distributions
in the context of Queueing Systems. We analyze the Probability Mass Function 
of the Poisson distribution and the Exponential distribution for different
lambda parameters. We also conduct decomposition and superposition on these 
distributions.

## Project 2
The second project is about M/M/1 and M/M/1/N queues and the way serving is done.
We define a system of birth and death rates, calculating the ergodic probabilities
as well as the transient ones up to a point of convergence.
