## Project 1
This first project is an analysis of the Poisson and Exponential Distributions
in the context of Queueing Systems. We analyze the Probability Mass Function 
of the Poisson distribution and the Exponential distribution for different
lambda parameters. We also conduct decomposition and superposition on these 
distributions.

## Project 2
The second project is about M/M/1 and M/M/1/N queues and the way serving is done.
We define a system of birth and death rates, calculating the ergodic probabilities
as well as the transient ones up to a point of convergence.

## Project 3 
The third project is a simulation of M/M/1/10 queue without the use of queueing or 
statistics libraries. We calculate the average amount of clients in the system for 
specific lambda and mu parameters. The first simulation shows that lambda is 
proportional to the time it takes for the system to converge to a steady state and 
the second simulation shows how the server of the queue can impact convergence 
when he slows down or speeds back up.
